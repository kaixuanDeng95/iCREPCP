<p>The data used in our research includes the core plant promoters and their strength in maize protoplasts system and tobacco leaves system (Jores, T., Tonnies, J., Wrightsman, T. et al. Synthetic promoter designs enabled by a comprehensive analysis of plant core promoters. Nat. Plants 7, 842â€“855 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-021-00932-y).<p>
<p>The strength of plant core promoter(labels of samples) is defined as the ability to drive expression of a barcoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The plant core promoter strengths of  Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum core promoters were measured by STARR-seq assays via tobacco leaves transient transfection systems tobacco leaves transient transfection systems with/without enhacer in dark or light.<p>
