-The data used in our research includes traning and testing data measured in maize protoplasts system and tobacco leaves system(Jores, T., Tonnies, J., Wrightsman, T. et al. Synthetic promoter designs enabled by a comprehensive analysis of plant core promoters. Nat. Plants 7, 842â€“855 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-021-00932-y).
-The strength of plant core promoter(labels of samples) is defined as the ability to drive expression of a barcoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. 16,736 Arabidopsis, 30,668 maize and 24,754 sorghum core promoters were measured by STARR-seq assays via tobacco leaves transient transfection systems and 17,465 Arabidopsis, 32,663 maize and 25,689 sorghum core promoters were measured by STARR-seq assays via tobacco leaves transient transfection systems.
